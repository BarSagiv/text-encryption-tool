# Python Encryption/Decryption Tool

This project is a Python-based text encryption and decryption tool using a simple **substitution cipher** method. You can either run it as a script or interact with it through a Command-Line Interface (CLI).

---

## What It Does

- Generates a **random encryption key** by shuffling the alphabet.
- Builds a corresponding **decryption key** from the encryption key.
- **Encrypts** plain text using the encryption key.
- **Decrypts** encrypted text using the decryption key.
- Provides a **CLI** for interactive encryption/decryption sessions.
